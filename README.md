All of my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

These puzzles were used as a way for me to learn and get comfortable with Rust
syntax, experimenting with features, etc. As such, the solutions are very
inconsistent in how they tackle problems. It's not clean but I learned a lot and
they all work (though some solutions aren't very robust).
